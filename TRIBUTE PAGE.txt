			<h2>About the Legend</h2>
			<p>
				A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.
				He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
				Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 1958.
				In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle designed and produced in India.
				Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which earned him the nickname "Missile Man."
				Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, launched in 1989.
				He also played a pivotal role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which established India as a nuclear power.
				Kalam received several honors and awards for his contributions to science and technology, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.
				He passed away on July 27, 2015, at the age of 83.
